The data are available in two forms. The openly accessible version shows only the country and (for some countries) the region where the respondent is practising. A second version shows, in addition, information about the respondents' gender and years since graduation, and the size and type of their practice; due to concerns over the potential for reidentification of participants from this information, it is available only on request.	1

Building practitioners are able to download the weather files for the place of interest based on post code or latitude and longitude via the COLBE/ZED-i Repository of Future Weather (https://colbe.bath.ac.uk/), after completing a survey on the use to which the weather data will be put.	1
Access on request to bone fide researchers.	1
The data files have been embargoed until three years after publication of the thesis.	1
Due to concerns about possible re-identification, access is granted to bona fide researchers only and successful access requests will be logged.	1
Access for bona fide researchers	1
When referring to this dataset, please cite the corrected version at https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-00997 instead of this version. There are, however, no changes to the files between versions.	1
This version does not include rarefaction curves and values of alpha-diversity, richness and evenness per sample. These have been added in Version 2 of this dataset, under the “OTU_table” tab of the spreadsheet.	1
This dataset is presented in the paper, "The mid-infrared Leavitt Law for Classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds", and used in a follow-up paper to explore the 3D structure of the Magellanic Clouds. The file is under embargo until the follow-up paper has been submitted to the journal to be considered for publication. After this, the file will become publicly available.	1
Restricted access data. External users to submit a request to access the data after it is published, to the University of Bath and Dr Gemma Taylor (gmjm20@bath.ac.uk)	1
In this version, the first scene in Preprocessed.zip ("Ballintoy") is missing the fitted scene-adaptive proxy geometry, and the scene "Crescent" in Unpreprocessed.zip contains an incorrect number of frames in the config file. Please refer to version 2 of the dataset for the corrected files.	1
The files are embargoed until 28 May 2021, after which they will be publicly available under licence.	1
The tool (written as a manuscript) is published in the Journal of Building Engineering.	1
Dataset created specifically for this research, can be access on reasonable request (by academics or bona fide researchers). Method is replicable through use of related coding sheets and protocol.	1
As this data contains sensitive information about a vulnerable group of young people relating to their maltreatment experience and mental health, it has some access restrictions. Please request access from the PhD student (Rosie McGuire) or their primary supervisor (Rachel Hiller), with information on how this data will be used.	1
Due to the type of consent participants gave, the data may only be used to verify the study for which it was collected and for further University of Bath research projects, and will be destroyed ten years after the study ended, which will be 24 September 2030. All successful requests for access will be logged.	1
